# Linux lightweight and alternative Web browser testing

- **webbrowser-app**

    Looks good, JS support, smallish footprint. No ACID3 support - crashed on acid test

* **arora**: Full ACID3 support, high-ish memory usage...ok
* **chimera2**: Total crap. Don't use
* **dillo**: Too featureless. Don't use 
* **dooble**: Focus on security/privacy. Low memory footprint. Search sucks. Somewhat OK
* **dwb**: WTF keyboard navigation...MIGHT be cool if I could read the goddamn settings keys (black on black). SHIT so far...
* **epiphany-browser**: Light interface. Low-ish memory usage but not great...moderate ok
* **hv3**: Crap
* **konqueror**: Feature bloat. Filemanager/editor/browser. Acid 3 compliance. Moderate memory usage. Maybe ok, need more testing
* **midori**: Seems ok, acid3 compliance. Light memory footprint. OK - use more to test
* **rekonq**: Kinda cool. Unique search engine hotkeys. Interface is a bit weird. OK
* **surf**: Keyboard only browser, nice fullscreen...seems a bit incomplete.  Good for an embeded browser...
* **uzbl**: Nice keyboard navigation...ok sometimes
* **xombrero**: VIM-keyboard focused browser. Lightweight. OK
